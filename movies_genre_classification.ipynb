    "\n",
    "### Project Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This project successfully demonstrates a multi-label classification approach for predicting movie genres. Here are the key achievements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Processing**: Successfully parsed and cleaned the TMDB movie dataset, handling JSON-like strings and merging multiple data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**: Created meaningful features by combining movie overviews, taglines, and keywords using TF-IDF vectorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Development**: Implemented a One-vs-Rest classifier with Logistic Regression that can predict multiple genres simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Performance**: Achieved reasonable performance with F1-micro score of 0.47, considering the complexity of multi-label classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Performance Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Subset Accuracy (12.90%)**: While this seems low, it's typical for multi-label problems where all labels must be correct\n",
    "- **F1-Micro (0.47)**: Indicates good performance at the individual genre level\n",
    "- **F1-Macro (0.23)**: Shows variation in performance across genres, likely due to class imbalance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Advanced NLP**: Use word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) or transformer models (BERT) for better text representation\n",
    "2. **Feature Enhancement**: Include cast, director, and production company information\n",
    "3. **Class Imbalance**: Apply techniques like SMOTE or cost-sensitive learning to handle genre imbalance\n",
    "4. **Deep Learning**: Experiment with neural networks for potentially better performance\n",
    "5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters using grid search or random search\n",
    "\n",
    "### Files Generated\n",
    "\n",
    "- `classified_movies_results.csv`: Contains original and predicted genres for all movies in the dataset\n",
    "- Genre distribution visualization showing the frequency of each genre in the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This project provides a solid foundation for movie genre classification and can be extended for recommendation systems or content analysis applications."
